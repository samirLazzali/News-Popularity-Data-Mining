       " 'To be clear, many pranks are mean, and even more of them are a waste of perfectly good office supplies. But there are a few pranks that are still pretty good, even for people who arent members of the \"epic prank\" community.IsApril Fools Daycoming up? A co-workers birthday, perhaps? Are you simply jonesing to do some pranks this week? (Why?) Then consider doing one of these pranks — theyre low-effort, high-reward, and do not involve spilled liquids of any kind.Best of all, weve divided them into \"Harmless Pranks\" and \"More Serious Pranks\" for a customized prank experience. If youre pranking someone whos never been pranked before, consider going for a harmless prank. If youre pranking someone with a little more experience — or perhaps an enemy who doesnt know theyre your enemy — go for a more serious prank.How youprankis a big decision, but we have faith in you!Happy pranking. Please stay safe.A harmless prank that might end with them loving ferrets!Image:  LightRocket via Getty ImagesSimply place their email address on a goofy newsletter or mailing list of your choosing. Not sure where to start? The Ferret Association of Connecticutpublishes three regular newsletters, apparently.Just so were clear on this one, there arent actually any deer.Notseeing deer is not a huge disappointment, though, which amps up the \"harmless prank\" factor here.Heres a roommate-specific example: hide their toothpaste and socks, but tell them you hid their toothpaste, socks,andcomb. Reveal the truth whenever!My brother has been replacing family photos with pics of Steve Buscemi and my mom hasnt noticedpic.twitter.com/d533C4yEZW— Clare Manion (@claremaura)July 24, 2016Another celebrity will work just as well. Try Bill Murray, Samuel L. Jackson, Jada Pinkett Smith, or Pink for a fun twist.*extremely vintage radio voice* The message theyre waiting for...will never arrive.My colleague Nicole has done this prank.Image:  Nicole GallucciAgain, reveal the truth whenever. If youre feeling guilty about your con, you can even reveal it instantly. And, yes,Guys Grocery Gamesis still on the air.You can finda nice box of pirate \"doubloons\" on Amazon. Hide them around the house and watch your loved ones believe, briefly, that they found some real and cool money. (They didnt.)Image:  NothingWell suggestnCage, but there are a lot to choose from. If you want to do a prank that is virtually undetectable (better for guilt), consider theNothingextension, which does nothing.Its a little corny, but it works. And its easily reversible, so your victim (friend) wont lose any of their beloved product.This prank, which comescourtesy of BuzzFeed, is simple and potentially very expensive. To pull it off, you must acquire four versions of the same hat, each a slightly different size. When youre hanging out with your friend (victim), excuse yourself periodically. Each time you return, you should be wearing a slightly larger version of the hat.Your investment, we assume, will pay off in confusion.It will make them think their home is infested with bugs, which is not a good thing to think. This is a full crafting project, though, so only attempt if youre willing to spend a little time.Another classic prank! Just make sure your victim (friend) can eat sugar without experiencing any adverse effects. Its important to stay safe and keep your friends (victims) safe, yall — even when youre taking a trip to PrankTown.Incredibly inconvenient, but at least balloons are, like, a fun item. Plus, popping balloons is a nice way to spend an afternoon, isnt it? You could even hide some stuff in the balloons, like confetti or something. Have fun with this simple prank.Auser on Quorais the source of this truly genius prank, which involves telling a lot of people that your friend is collecting trash for a \"project.\" Then, of course, their life will suddenly fill with unwanted garbage.Its actually apple slices, yogurt, and a peach half. Devastating.You can just use a piece of tape if you want, or you can tape a picture of yourself on there. This good prank has lots of room for customization.Image:  Getty Images for SXSWThey will hate you after this, so be prepared.Just a lil rubber snake peeking out from their sweaters. No big deal. Unless theyre afraid of snakes, in which case it might be a huge deal.Which are these? Who can be sure.Image:  Glenn Koenig/Los Angeles Times/Getty ImagesPeople get very angry about this for some reason. Personally, we love oatmeal raisin cookies, but your victim (friend) will probably say something along the lines of \"this is why I have trust issues\" — the telltale sign of a successful prank.We hesitated to put this one on the list because its so mean. There is nothing meaner than a jump scare, particularly when you know your friend (victim) doesnt like jump scares. Still, its an iconic prank that doesnt require any materials — other than a profound lack of empathy, of course.')"
